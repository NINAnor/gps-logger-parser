- ALWAYS attempt to add a test case for changed behavior
- PREFER running specific tests over running the entire test suite
- ALWAYS read and copy the style of similar tests when adding new cases
- AVOID shortening variable names, e.g., use version instead of ver, and requires_python instead of rp
- ALWAYS use `uv` to run commands
- ALWAYS make sure `ruff` does not return errors
